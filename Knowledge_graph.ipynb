barrier structures crash dummies different impactor devices. software development modeling technology evolved towards ever larger detailed numerical models vehicle quest accuracy reliability results. software development primarily fought battle trying run manage models continuously increasing size using essentially basic technology. first important focus point development animation packages rapid post processing simulations. packages allowed visualization simulated crash event deformation modes car body display plastic strain stresses energy densities individual parts. allowed engineer immediately identify components absorb less energy. similarly high emphasis placed finite element analytical techniques applications structural design page interactive pre processing software models. main goal quickly incorporate structural changes existing numerical model. main programming effort increase efficiency solvers. explicit finite element codes optimized point run percent vectorized mode. although must said element by element nature codes lends particularly well vectorized processing certainly remarkable achievement considering nodal force assembly search algorithms contact impact routines. similar even important effort continuously displayed parallelization codes achieving ever better scaling performance shared memory distributed memory machines. major advance replacement node based contact search algorithms so called segment based search algorithms. old algorithms based search nearest master node every slave node always computer time consuming even bucket sorting improves situation. new segment based search methods algorithm introduced computationally much efficient also improves many shortcomings older algorithms. finally number techniques developed order allow explicit simulations run constant timestep value. first seems non trivial matter since stable time step analysis linearly dependent upon shortest mesh dimension model. deformation changes reduces dimension drop timestep seems mathematically unavoidable. indeed possible keep constant timestep crash simulation highly deforming shell elements without changing physics problem. several methods developed achieve. vary so called small strain formulations influence change geometry upon element stiffness ignored certain point entire analysis controlled reduction material elastic modulus plastically deforms. widely used method mass scaling. element dimension decreases corresponding material density nodal masses increased way resulting time step remains constant. options render crashworthiness simulations feasible useful percent cases. although physics problem locally modified major objection one considers local stress distributions must wrong mass scaling constant timestep options applied. since vehicle crash nature small strain event large membrane strains really occur shell elements represent car body. consequently mesh dimensions change timestep ideally constant. vehicle crashworthiness occupant protection page true mesh sufficiently fine order give smooth representation deformed crashed vehicle geometry including high curvatures may occur. practice rarely

integration system ordinary differential equations govern behavior model. solution obtained computer approximation correct analytical solution. main problem early simulation work clearly coarseness shell element mesh representing car body. resulted simulation low curvature high wavelength buckling modes thus constantly overestimated energy absorption structure since high curvature modes precluded simulation outlay mesh. coarse meshes generally resulted stiff behavior energy absorbing highly deforming structural parts. weak link chain clearly mode additional loss accuracy due use simple algorithms almost welcome. algorithmic deficiencies tended compensate errors due coarseness finite element mesh. penetrations allowed due failing contact algorithms zero energy modes underintegrated shell elements would weaken structural response thus improve correlation numerical measured results. today situation reversed. greater potential improvement near future lies use

current model sizes roughly elements single class load cases frontal side rear homogeneous mesh roughly elements load cases could reasonable model size crashworthiness engineering purposes. assumes improved contact algorithms edge to edge capability used conjunction fully integrated least physically stabilized shell elements. required computer time estimated three four times current technology requires. vehicle crashworthiness occupant protection page approximately half numerical problems modern crashworthiness analysis work caused edge to edge penetrations. early explicit simulations example defense industry never problem since contacts convex surfaces low curvature considered consequently node to segment contact algorithms sufficient generality detect occurring penetrations. longer case automotive structures. complex surfaces high double curvature discretized somewhat too large finite elements resulting polygonal surface lots kinks edges. edge to edge penetrations go undetected since cause nodal penetrations segments. cause problems except making model less stiff actual structure penetrations occur. however consequent movements penetrated segments easily lead so called impacts nodes segments from wrong side contacts tangled structures lead extremely high local contact forces since entire structural parts may hung upon single node. suanomalies models lead local instabilities hourglassing due extreme out of plane loads potentially abort simulation prematurely. way provided classical contact algorithms set tangled nodes free allow penetration without checks resulting loss realism edge to edge algorithms currently introduced commercial explicit finite element codes. second improvement efficient neutralization zero energy hourglass modes shell

page first possibility cope problem seems full integration using four gauss integration points element bilinearly interpolated element. unfortunately rather straightforward solution work fully underintegrated elements uniform bilinear interpolation suffer another drawback called shear locking. shear locking occurs non zero out of plane shear strains predicted element conditions pure bending resulting overly stiff element response. problem caused uniform interpolation out of plane deflections interpolated higher order rather bilinear functions formulations exhibit shear locking possible. however dramatically increases complexity implementation decreases element performance. development fully integrated element avoids shear locking maintains simplicity uniform bilinear interpolation proven challenging task. several solutions exist neutralize hourglass modes using uniform bilinear interpolation avoiding shear locking. first possibility selective reduced integration sri elements. solution consists performing full integration membrane bending strains combined reduced integration out of plane shear strains. elements effectively avoid shear locking rectangular elements problems still occur irregular meshes. second solution corresponds assumed natural coordinate strain ans elements. isoparametric coordinate field longer differentiated improved estimates out of plane shear strain field used directly. approach leads formulation without shear locking independently quadrature rule used reduced integration full integration implementations exist commercial explicit finite

particular ans element passes kichhoff patch test whereas elements classical quadrature shear strains always fail rather elementary requirement. efficient fully integrated ans element exists ls dyna code overcomes hourglassing shear locking problems cost roughly three times original belytschko tsay shell element. full integration still perceived efficient enough allow parametric studies large

non constant part strain. vehicle crashworthiness occupant protection page constitutive law invoked order estimate hourglass stresses resulting set nodal forces supposed correct missing stiffness components element rather exactly. approach much efficient full reduced selective integration requires percent computer time original belytschko tsay element. element also passes kichhoff patch test. next existence zero energy modes second potential problem highly efficient belytschko tsay shell element limitation flat geometries. results use mindlin plate theory fiber direction assumed coincide normal plate surface. assumption used warped elements bending strain underestimated two reasons. first rotations normal element cause curvature calculated although rotations may parallel nodal drill.

twisted beam test element. efficient coupling membrane bending deformation advocated. formulations allow accurate modeling surfaces double curvature using warped elements warp angles degrees. emphasized strongly none improvements described affect original assumption small deformations exist within single shell element. improvements merely meant correct deficiencies element formulations
